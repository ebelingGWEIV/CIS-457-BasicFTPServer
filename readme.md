To run the server, run the following command in a terminal with this directory opened.

`python3 runFileServer.py`

To connect to the server, open a browser and navigate to `127.0.0.1:1609`. This will open `127.0.0.1:1609/home.html`, but this page could be navigated to specifically. Other pages can be navigated to by entering their filepath, but the file must exist within the WebDir directory.
